# Employee-Database-Management-System

## Organize all of your employee information, logistical and finacial, in one convenient place! 

Welcome to the Employee Database Management System. Using the combined power of MySQL, Node.js, and several npm packages, managing your employees has never been easier. By using javascript to feed MySQL prepared statements, you can effortlessly create employees, departments, and roles within those departments.

- Create Employees using a first and last name. 
- Create a department within your company. 
- Create roles within each department, and assign salaries to these roles. 
- The database system also allows you to create managerial relationships between employees in the database.  
- And much more!


## Up and Running 

In order to use this application, you will need Node.js and to install the following npm packages: 
- mysql2
- inquirer 
- dotenv if you wish to protect your database password. 

After setting up these dependencies, you are set and ready to run this from the command line! Simply run `node index.js` and you will be prompted with a series of questions to create your database.
